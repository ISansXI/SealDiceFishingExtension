# 项目目标
虽然仍然在制作，但是项目的目标就是为了给广大赛博钓鱼佬们体验在互联网与其他人一起钓(kong)鱼(jun)，灵感来源于犯困时的突发奇想。
目前项目要实现的功能规划如下:
> 1. 允许玩家花费本脚本的钱币cp来添加新的鱼类供给所有人去钓，以及修改已经上传的鱼类的功能，上传后经骰主审核通过即可出现在赛博钓鱼佬们的视野内。
> 2. 钓鱼佬的体力系统，包括钓鱼消耗体力，每天限制体力恢复等。
> 3. 钓鱼佬的财产系统，包括鱼类财产和钱币财产、排行榜、展示柜，以及玩家间开赛博商店贸易鱼类/渔具/饵料等类似财产的功能，当然还有系统商店。
> 4. 不同的钓鱼地点在不同的时间(日间，夜间)可以钓到不同的鱼，计划通过鱼类的Tags来进行筛选。钓鱼地点计划也可以上传审核。
> 5. 很遥远的饼の远洋冒险
> 6. 其他基本功能...

# Project Objectives
Although still in production, the goal of the project is to give the majority of cyberfishers the experience of fishing with others on the Internet (kong) fish (jun), inspired by the sudden idea of sleep.
The current functional planning of the project is as follows:
> 1. Allow the player to spend the coin cp of this script to add new fish for everyone to fish, and modify the function of the uploaded fish,  which can appear in the view of the cybertrolls after the die master review.
> 2. The physical system of the fishers, including the physical consumption of fishing, limiting physical recovery every day, etc.
> 3. The troller's property system, including fish property and coin property, leaderboards, display cases, as well as the function of opening  cybershops between players to trade fish/fishing gear/bait and similar property, and of course the system store.
> 4. Different fishing sites can catch different fish at different times (day and night), and it is planned to screen by fish Tags. Fishing location plans can also be uploaded for review.
> 5. Faraway pie の Ocean adventure
> 6. Other basic functions...
